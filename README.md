Thank you for your interest in my project.

Execute the "Main.py" script if you want to get the elements to recreate the dashboard. This going to create a new folder called "Query_results" with the necessary excel files. 

I use the pycountry library in order to get the official names of the countries based on their alpha-3 codes, so I recommend you to install it, otherwise you have to modify the "Development_and_sociodemographic_index" script ubicated in the "Scripts" folder.
